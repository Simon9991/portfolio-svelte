# Portfolio
My personnal **portolio**, developped using [`SvelteKit`](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com).
The **backend** of this project will be written using `Rust` and will come in a seperate `GitHub` repository.

## What you need
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) - to be able to install the depedencies.
- Not hating me for putting static images for the moment (they will be stored as an adress later, everything is ok)

## Running the project
First run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) and then start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
You can then see the result by accessing [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173/) (the port may be different based on which ones are available).
